# OneBusCalc

This is a small and simple physical address calculator for Famiclone OneBus systems.

The info on how to calculate these addresses are from the [manual](http://www.vrt.com.tw/old_site/admin/upload/datasheet/VT02%20Data%20Sheet%20RevisionA5_ENG__1.pdf).

Additional info on horizontal and vertical arrangements are from the [NesDev site](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/INES).

Register values must be in hex mode!

Note: I do not really code often in C# - this is still quite unoptimized. More improvements coming soon! :D
